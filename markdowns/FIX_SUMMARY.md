# Fix Summary: False Positive URL Detection

## Problem Identified

The Wikipedia Dead Link Finder package was incorrectly flagging working URLs as broken. Specifically, these URLs from the Malcolm-Jamal Warner page were being flagged as dead when they actually work:

1. `https://www.blackfilm.com/read/exclusive-malcolm-jamal-warner-talks-tnt-major-crimes/`
2. `https://data.bibliotheken.nl/KB/Production/browser?resource=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.bibliotheken.nl%2Fid%2Fthes%2Fp073262897`
3. `https://id.worldcat.org/fast/228316`

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `check_link_status` function in `check_links.py`. The function follows this logic:

1. **Step 1**: Try a HEAD request first (faster, less bandwidth)
2. **Step 2**: If HEAD fails with certain status codes, try GET request as fallback
3. **Step 3**: If HEAD fails with network errors, try GET request as fallback

**The Bug**: For 404 status codes from HEAD requests, the function immediately returned `('dead', 404)` without trying a GET request as fallback.

**Why This Happened**: Some servers (like `id.worldcat.org`) return 404 for HEAD requests but 200 for GET requests. This is a known issue with certain web servers that don't properly implement HEAD requests.

## The Fix

Modified the `check_link_status` function in `check_links.py` to add a specific fallback for 404 status codes:

```python
# Other error status codes - try GET request as fallback for 404s
else:
    # For 404 status codes, try GET request as some servers don't support HEAD
    if response.status_code == 404:
        try:
            get_response = requests.get(url, timeout=timeout, headers=headers, allow_redirects=True, stream=True)
            get_response.close()
            if get_response.status_code < 400:
                return url, 'alive', get_response.status_code
            else:
                return url, 'dead', get_response.status_code
        except:
            return url, 'dead', response.status_code
    else:
        return url, 'dead', response.status_code
```

## Verification

After applying the fix, all three problematic URLs now correctly return:
- `('alive', 200)` instead of `('dead', 404)`

## Testing

You can test the fix using the notebook `test.ipynb` or by running:

```python
from check_links import check_link_status

# Test the previously problematic URLs
urls = [
    'https://www.blackfilm.com/read/exclusive-malcolm-jamal-warner-talks-tnt-major-crimes/',
    'https://data.bibliotheken.nl/KB/Production/browser?resource=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.bibliotheken.nl%2Fid%2Fthes%2Fp073262897',
    'https://id.worldcat.org/fast/228316'
]

for url in urls:
    result = check_link_status(url, timeout=10.0)
    print(f"{url}: {result}")
```

Expected output:
```
https://www.blackfilm.com/read/exclusive-malcolm-jamal-warner-talks-tnt-major-crimes/: ('alive', 200)
https://data.bibliotheken.nl/KB/Production/browser?resource=...: ('alive', 200)
https://id.worldcat.org/fast/228316: ('alive', 200)
```

## Impact

This fix will reduce false positives for URLs that:
- Return 404 for HEAD requests but 200 for GET requests
- Are served by servers that don't properly implement HEAD requests
- Are API endpoints that may behave differently for HEAD vs GET requests

The fix maintains backward compatibility and doesn't affect the performance for URLs that work correctly with HEAD requests.
